# Feroz's Portfolio Projects - [ferozfaiz.com](https://ferozfaiz.com)

### Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio project, showcased at [ferozfaiz.com](https://ferozfaz.com). It has different segments, each demonstrating a distinct feature of my work in web and software development.

### Project Summaries

1. [**Spring Boot API**](https://github.com/nartix/spring-boot-api)

   - I developed this Spring Boot API for use with a Next.js application thatâ€™s currently under development. The API relies on PostgreSQL as the primary database, is secured through OpenID Connect, and leverages Hashicorp Vault for secret management. The application is deployed on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. A live version is available at [spring-boot-api.ferozfaiz.com](https://spring-boot-api.ferozfaiz.com)

1. [**Django**](https://github.com/nartix/django-blog)

   - I developed ferozfaiz.com using Django, focusing on a fully server-side rendered architecture. To enhance interactivity and reactivity, I integrated HTMX and AlpineJS. Additionally, I implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication, supporting both Google and Microsoft. I used RabbitMQ/Celery to send emails. Kakfa was used to ship logs to ElasticSearch/Grafana. I also used Hashicorp Vault to store secrets. The application is deployed on Kubernetes. A live version is available at [ferozfaiz.com](https://ferozfaiz.com)

2. [**ReactJS UI**](https://github.com/nartix/reactjs-ui):

   - This repository highlights my work with ReactJS 18.2 and Redux. This ReactJS project is a web application that allows users to create, read, update, delete, sort, and search data. A live version is available at [reactjs.ferozfaiz.com](https://reactjs.ferozfaiz.com)

3. [**Angular UI**](https://github.com/nartix/angular-ui):

   - This directory contains the developement codes of Angular 16.2, a structural framework for dynamic web apps. This Angular project is a web application that allows users to perform the same CRUD operations as the ReactJS app. A live version is available at [angular.ferozfaiz.com](https://angular.ferozfaiz.com)

4. [**@nartix/tiptap-inline-code-highlight**](https://github.com/nartix/tiptap-inline-code-highlight):

   - This npm package I created is a port of @tiptap/extension-code-block-lowlight, but it's for highlighting inline codes in the TipTap editor. It uses Lowlight to highlight codes.

5. [**ExpressJS API**](https://github.com/nartix/expressjs-api):

   - This ExpressJS project is an API that ReactJS and Angular use to enable users to perform CRUD operations. A live version is available at [expressjs.ferozfaiz.com](https://expressjs.ferozfaiz.com)

6. [**Python And Django**](https://github.com/nartix/feroz/tree/main/python):

   - I also learned Django and developed an API backend with Django Rest Framework 3.14. This was designed to parallel the functionality of the existing ExpressJS API backend of ferozfaiz.com. A live version is available at [django-rest-framework.ferozfaiz.com](https://django-rest-framework.ferozfaiz.com)

7. [**Ansible-Kubernetes**](https://github.com/nartix/feroz/tree/main/ansible-kubernetes):

   - This directory shows how I use Ansible for automation and orchestration, along with Kubernetes for container orchestration. I deployed the portfolio project website using the RKE2 kubernetes engine.

8. [**HAProxy**](https://github.com/nartix/feroz/tree/main/haproxy):

   - This section is dedicated to HAProxy, a high-availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP applications. I used HAProxy to load balance traffic between Kubernetes nodes.

9. [**Kubernetes**](https://github.com/nartix/feroz/tree/main/kubernetes):

   - Within this directory, you'll find the Kubernetes deployment manifests that I utilized for deploying ferozfaiz.com.

10. [**Shell-PostgreSQL-Docker**](https://github.com/nartix/feroz/tree/main/shell-postgresql-docker):

   - This section features shell scripts I developed for backing up and restoring a PostgreSQL cluster from an AWS S3 bucket

11. [**Github Actions**](https://github.com/nartix/feroz/tree/main/.github/workflows):

   - I've utilized GitHub Actions to streamline the automation of my deployment containers' build process, as well as the subsequent pushing of the built containers to AWS ECR

12. Development
   - For my portfolio projects, I employed Docker containers in conjunction with Docker Compose for development and testing. Utilizing Docker containers simplifies the process of experimenting with various technology versions seamlessly. Additionally, I leveraged Git for efficient version control
